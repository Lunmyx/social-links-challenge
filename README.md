## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I learned about media queries and font-face, responsive design and about mobile first. Also learned how to properly use Github for repos and setting up a github page to host the website. I also relearned lots of stuff like the use of divs, css classes and effects like transition.


### Continued development

I really want to study more about mobile first and responsiveness and more dynamic effects on interactive elements.
